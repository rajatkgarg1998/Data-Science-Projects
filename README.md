# Speech Recognition

This project implements a speech recognition system using Recurrence Plots (RP) as a fundamental technique. Recurrence Plots are used to analyze the similarity and patterns within time-series data, making them suitable for tasks like speech recognition where identifying patterns in audio signals is crucial.

## Installation
You can use the any python editor to run the code. I have used the Googlecollab for my execution.

Install my-project on Googlecollab using pip:

```bash
  pip install pyunicorn
```
```bash
  pip install netCDF4
```
```bash
  pip install audiomentations
```

    
## Features

Speech Data Handling: Processes audio data to extract relevant features for RP analysis.

Recurrence Plot Generation: Constructs Recurrence Plots from the extracted features.

Pattern Recognition: Applies pattern recognition algorithms on Recurrence Plots to classify speech signals.


## Requirements

Python 3.x

Dependencies (list them, e.g., numpy, librosa, matplotlib)

(Any hardware requirements, e.g., minimum RAM, GPU)
```
```bash
  pip install audiomentations
```
