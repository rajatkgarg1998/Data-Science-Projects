# Speech Recognition

Took the audio sample of different speakers of 16KHZ,
where each speaker has spoken Hindi Alphabets.
Broken down each audio into equal segments and
created the recurrence plot of each segment using
pyunicorn Library.
Used the convo2D Neural Network for training the
dataset and predicted the speakers.
